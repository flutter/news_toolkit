The Google Flutter team and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/) have co-sponsored the development of a news application template. Our goal is to help news publishers build apps and monetize them more easily in order to make reliable information accessible to all.

This template aims to **reduce the time to develop a typical news app by 80%**.

The Flutter News Toolkit:

- Contains common news app UI workflows and core features built with Flutter and Firebase
- Implements best practices for news apps based on [Google News Initiative research](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/info/assets/static/docs/nci/nci-playbook-en.pdf)
- Allows publishers to monetize immediately with pre-built Google Ads and subscription services
