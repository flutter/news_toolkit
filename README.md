Flutter and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/) have co-sponsored the development of a news application template. The goal of this project is to help news publishers build mobile applications easily in order to make reliable information accessible to all.

This template aims to **significantly reduce the development time for typical news applications** by giving developers a head start on core components and features.

The Flutter News Toolkit:

- Contains common news app UI workflows and core features built with Flutter and Firebase
- Implements best practices for news apps based on [Google News Initiative research](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/info/assets/static/docs/nci/nci-playbook-en.pdf)
- Allows publishers to monetize immediately with ads and subscription services

Common services such as authentication, notifications, analytics, and ads have been implemented using [Firebase](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview/) and [Google Mobile Ads](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads). Developers are free to substitute these services and can find publicly available packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

If you're just getting started with Flutter, we recommend first developing familiarity with the framework by reviewing the [onboarding guides](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), [tutorials](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/tutorials), and [codelabs](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs) before using this template.
